<h1>SRV Computer Lab Check Project</h1>
<p>This project is a web-based system for checking in and out of the computer lab in SRV. It is designed to provide an
    efficient and organized way of tracking the usage of the computer lab.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Check-in and check-out system for students using the computer lab</li>
    <li>Record-keeping of student information and the date and time of usage</li>
    <li>Data conversion from JSON to Excel and vice versa for data analysis and storage</li>
    <li>User-friendly interface for both students and administrators</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development</li>
    <li>Python for back-end development and data processing</li>
    <li>Pandas and Openpyxl libraries for data manipulation and conversion</li>
    <li>JSON for data storage and retrieval</li>
</ul>
<h2>Module Installation</h2>
<h3>1. pandas</h3>
<p>pandas is a popular data analysis library for Python. It is used to read and manipulate the data stored in the
    system. To install pandas, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre>pip install pandas</pre>
<h3>2. openpyxl</h3>
<p>openpyxl is a library for reading and writing Excel files. It is used in SRV Computer Lab Check to write data to an
    Excel spreadsheet. To install openpyxl, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre>pip install openpyxl</pre>
<h3>3. shutil</h3>
<p>shutil is a library for file management operations. It is used in SRV Computer Lab Check to copy old data files to
    the correct directory. To install shutil, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre>pip install shutil</pre>
<h3>4. time</h3>
<p>time is a built-in library for handling time-related operations. It is used in SRV Computer Lab Check to add a delay
    before copying old data files to the correct directory. To use the time library, simply import it in your code as
    follows:</p>
<pre>import time</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this system, students simply need to enter their student ID and basic information. The system will then record
    the date and time of their check-in and check-out, as well as the lab room they are using. The collected data can
    then be processed and analyzed by the administrators for various purposes, such as tracking the usage patterns of
    the computer lab or monitoring the behavior of the students.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The SRV Computer Lab Check Project is a useful tool for managing and monitoring the usage of the computer lab in SRV.
    With its user-friendly interface and efficient data processing capabilities, it provides a convenient and organized
    solution for tracking the usage of the computer lab and ensuring its proper utilization by the students.</p>
<p>
    SRV Computer Lab Check is a system that provides a convenient and organized solution for tracking the usage of the
    computer lab. The system allows students to check in and check out of the lab, with information such as their
    student ID, name, grade, gender, check-in and check-out time, and lab room being recorded. This information is
    stored in a database, which can then be processed and analyzed for various purposes, such as generating monthly
    usage reports.
</p>
<p>
    The system is made up of two main components: a front-end interface for students to use and a back-end for
    processing and organizing the data. The front-end interface is a simple web-based form that students can access and
    fill out to check in and check out of the lab. The form requests the required information from the students, such as
    their student ID, name, and lab room, and then records this information in the database.
</p>
<p>
    The back-end component of the system is responsible for processing and organizing the data collected from the
    front-end form. The data is stored in a JSON file and can be easily converted into other formats, such as a
    spreadsheet or a chart, for further analysis and visualization. The back-end also provides the capability to copy
    old data for historical record-keeping.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure the security and privacy of the data, the system is designed to run on a secure server, with access
    restricted to authorized personnel only. The system also regularly backs up the data to prevent loss in case of any
    technical issues.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, SRV Computer Lab Check offers a comprehensive solution for tracking the usage of the computer lab,
    providing an efficient and organized method for recording and analyzing the data. The system is simple to use and
    offers a range of processing capabilities, making it an ideal choice for any educational institution looking to
    manage its computer lab resources effectively.
